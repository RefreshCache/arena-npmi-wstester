This simple PHP script provides a way to invoke Arena web service API calls and display the resulting XML on a web page. You will need to know the syntax and parameters of the various API calls, which is typically available at /api.svc/help on your Arena installation. This script uses PHP server-side access to the web services so you can install it on any machine that can connect to your Arena environment.
